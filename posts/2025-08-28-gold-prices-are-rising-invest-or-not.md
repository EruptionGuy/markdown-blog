# What Influences Gold Prices?

Gold has long been part of the global economic world, and it is considered a safe-haven asset. In times of uncertainty, it is highly demanded without generating interest or dividends. There are several factors that influence the gold price, including interest rate, geopolitical events, economic performance, inflation, and market sentiment. 

# Gold vs. Other Investments

When gold is compared to other investments, its use and limitations are seen more clearly. For example, when the FED increases interest rates, the returns of alternative assets like bonds and savings are more attractive, putting downward pressure on gold prices (Investopedia,2015). However, during a period of high-tension geopolitics or economic uncertainty, where confidence towards other financial assets declines, gold acts as a safe haven (Investopedia, 2024). Gold offers a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation, maintaining its value unlike stocks or cryptocurrencies (CBS News, 2023).

# Gold’s Cultural Context in Vietnam

In Vietnam, the meaning of gold goes beyond investments; it plays a part in culture and practices. Gold jewelry can be gifted in important events such as weddings or the Lunar New Year because it symbolizes wealth and prosperity. For a long time, gold was seen as a medium of exchange, and today, gold plays a role in storing value during economic uncertainty. Gold's cultural importance influences investing behaviours, with the Vietnamese people viewing it as a wealth and possession.

# Pros and Cons of Gold for Young Investors

For young investors, gold on one hand has the advantages of being a safe-haven, inflation hedging, and portfolio diversification. Gold can retain its value, protecting purchasing power during a period of high inflation and lower overall risk when facing economic downturns. On the other hand, gold does not generate yield or dividends, which can be a huge drawback for young investors seeking high returns; gold has high price volatility causing price swings which requires patience (TechBullion, 2024); and physical gold needs storage making it less convenient than digital assets, young investors might prefer convenience. In spite of all the drawbacks, gold can be a reliable asset during uncertain times.
