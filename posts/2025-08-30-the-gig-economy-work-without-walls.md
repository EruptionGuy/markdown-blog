## *The term “gig” is a slang word for a job that lasts a specified time. It is borrowed from the music world, where performers book a gig \- a single or short-term engagement at various venues.*

The Gig Economy, often seen as modern, actually began in the 1910s with jazz musicians using “gig” for one-off performances. It grew during the Great Depression, when many turned to temporary or odd jobs to survive. After WWII, temp agencies filled short-term labor gaps. The 1990s internet boom transformed gig work, with platforms like Craigslist and early freelancing sites improving job access. By the late 2000s, companies like Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the model, turning everyday assets into income. Today, digital platforms offer flexible, on-demand work, giving individuals more autonomy and helping businesses stay agile. In a fast-evolving world, the Gig Economy is vital for providing adaptable, accessible employment where traditional jobs can’t keep up.

In the United States, it is estimated that about one-third of the population is operating in some form of gig economy. The number is expected to rise as more organizations adopt independent contractor work in order to save time and money. It is also estimated that 1.6 million workers worldwide get their income from the Gig Economy.

# Definition and Nature of Gig Work

The Gig Economy, also known as the “sharing economy” or “access economy”, relies heavily on temporary and part-time positions filled by independent contractors and freelancers rather than full-time permanent employees. It is a segment of the service economy based on flexible, temporary, or freelance jobs, often involving connecting clients and customers through an online platform.

The Gig Economy is not a new phenomenon as freelancers have been around for a while, so have consultants, temps, etc. The reason why the Gig Economy has been under scrutiny for the past couple of years is that technology has lowered barriers to entry so much that “gigs” have become easily accessible to an unprecedented number of people.

# Tech Platforms Behind It

## Airbnb

**Airbnb** (an abbreviation of its original name, **"Air Bed and Breakfast"**) is an American company operating an online marketplace for short-and long-term homestays, experiences, and services in various countries and regions. It acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. Airbnb was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. It is the best-known company for short-term housing rentals.

The Airbnb platform’s success rests on sophisticated machine learning algorithms—used for search ranking, pricing optimization, and demand forecasting—that enhance user experience and enable efficient matching between hosts and guests. More recently, Airbnb has expanded its scope beyond lodging by integrating local service bookings, such as private chefs, childcare providers, and wellness offerings, reflecting a strategic move to become a comprehensive "everything app" that extends tech-enabled opportunities to more service providers

## Grab

**Grab** operates a multi-service super‑app across Southeast Asia, originating as a ride‑hailing service in 2012 and later adding food delivery, logistics, payments, and financial services. With over 280,000 jobs created in Thailand alone and contributing significantly to the national GDP, Grab exemplifies how integrated platform technology can empower large-scale gig participation. The company emphasizes flexibility, earnings sustainability, insurance coverage, real-time payouts, and driver upskilling, leveraging data-driven incentives and algorithmic dispatch systems to balance supply and demand while enhancing driver welfare. Regional case studies and partnerships, such as with UNCDF, highlight Grab’s commitment to financial inclusion, sustainable livelihoods, and broader economic participation through its digital infrastructure.

## DoorDash

**DoorDash** is one of the leading food delivery platforms in the U.S, connecting independent “Dashers” with customers via a mobile app that handles order dispatch, navigation, payments, and earnings—all underpinned by real-time data and geo‑optimization. The platform supports third-party financial tools, such as instant‑pay and mileage‑tracking apps, to help gig workers manage income and expenses more effectively. Despite heavy reliance on algorithmic monitoring—ranging from delivery time enforcement to identity verification—DoorDash has also begun experimenting with hybrid models that employ W‑2 employees for some local delivery roles, signaling adaptation in response to labor policy debates and operational efficiencies. As a tech intermediary, it wields significant influence over driver behavior and experience, navigating ongoing tensions around flexibility, worker protections, and platform accountability.

# Benefits & Challenges

## Benefits

### For Businesses/Employers

**Cost-Effectiveness:** The gig economy helps businesses cut costs by hiring independent contractors instead of full-time employees. This eliminates expenses like benefits, paid leave, and retirement plans. Companies can also reduce or avoid office-related costs by relying on remote workers. As a result, businesses operate with a leaner budget and greater financial flexibility.

**Labor Force:** Employers benefit from direct access to a wide freelance labor pool, avoiding recruitment agencies and lengthy hiring processes. This speeds up onboarding, reduces administrative work, and allows businesses to find skilled workers on demand for specific tasks or projects.

**Output Production:** The flexibility offered by gig work often attracts highly motivated freelancers. Since they value autonomy and are typically paid per task, they tend to focus on results. For businesses, this leads to higher productivity and better-quality outcomes without needing strict oversight, making output both efficient and cost-effective.

### For Workers/Employees

**Independence:** Gig workers enjoy a high level of independence, as they aren't tied to traditional office settings. Whether writing from home or driving for a rideshare service, they choose their work environment. This autonomy gives workers more control over their daily routines and personal comfort.

**Flexibility:** One of the biggest appeals for gig workers is flexible scheduling. They often receive tasks with deadlines, but can decide when to complete them. This allows for better work-life balance and the freedom to plan around personal commitments or preferences.

**Income:** The gig economy offers opportunities for individuals to earn extra income on their own terms. Whether supplementing a main job or working full-time gigs, workers can take on as many tasks as they want. The flexibility to scale work up or down provides financial adaptability.

## Challenges

### For Business/Employers

**Worker Commitment:** Businesses in the gig economy often face challenges with worker commitment. Freelancers may lack long-term loyalty or connection to the company, reducing motivation and consistency. Since many gig roles lack incentives or growth opportunities, employers may struggle to build reliable teams or encourage repeat collaboration.

**Ethical Issues:** Companies relying heavily on gig workers can face ethical criticism. Hiring freelancers without benefits, job security, or competitive wages may harm the company’s reputation. Public scrutiny over such practices can impact brand image and reduce consumer trust.

### For Workers/Employees

**Lack of Benefits:** Gig workers are typically classified as independent contractors, meaning they aren't entitled to benefits like health insurance, paid leave, or retirement plans. This lack of support can leave workers vulnerable, especially in times of illness or financial uncertainty.

**Personal Expenses:** Workers in the gig economy often have to cover their own work-related costs. Whether it's fuel for delivery drivers or equipment for freelancers, these out-of-pocket expenses reduce overall earnings and add financial pressure.  
Isolation: Freelance work can be isolating, especially without coworkers or a team environment. While some enjoy solitude, others may struggle with loneliness, which can impact mental well-being and long-term productivity.

# Case Study: RMIT Student Using Grab & Freelance Gigs

An RMIT University design student shared her experience working in the gig economy alongside her studies. Through platforms like Grab and freelance Facebook pages, she found flexible gig roles that fit around university commitments. The student emphasizes that "the Gig Economy provided flexibility in working hours as well as workplaces," allowing her to multitask—balancing academic responsibilities with income‑earning activities.

This flexibility yielded key benefits: The student reported reduced stress and improved work–life balance, stating the model "absolutely creates job opportunities for students like her to join". She leveraged gigs to manage tuition and living expenses, all while gaining transferable skills in communication, budgeting, and remote work.

However, the case also highlights major downsides: job insecurity and lack of legal protection. The student notes that gig roles come with unstable income and no labor rights, versus traditional employment. She underscores that these contracts “lack protection” and are subject to customer feedback, which can disrupt earnings. Consequently, gig work demands self-reliance—students must actively manage cash flow and develop diverse skills to stay competitive.

Overall, this case shows how gig platforms empower students with autonomy and real-world experience, but also underscore the importance of financial planning and skill diversification. It’s a practical illustration of flexibility vs precarity in today’s gig-driven student workforce.
