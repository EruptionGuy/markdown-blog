On April 2, 2025, President Trump imposed “reciprocal” tariffs on all countries. Vietnam faced a 46% tariff. As a major exporter to the United States, Vietnam’s economy could be significantly impacted.

# Why Was Vietnam’s Tariff So High?

Before addressing the impacts of a 46% tariff on Vietnam’s economy, let’s examine the possible reasons why President Trump imposed such a high tariff.

First, America’s trade deficit with Vietnam has grown significantly and is now the largest among all U.S. trading partners. The President is using tariffs to pressure Vietnam into increasing imports from the United States to help rebalance trade. In 2024, while US exports to Vietnam totaled only $13.1 billion, imports from Vietnam reached $136.6 billion. This resulted in a trade deficit of $123.5 billion, which was an 18.1 percent increase ($18.9 billion) over 2023 (USTR, 2018).

Second, the U.S. believes Vietnam is being used as a “back door” for Chinese exports. Some Chinese-made goods evade tariffs by shipping to Vietnam, getting relabeled, and then being exported to the United States. Many electronic products assembled in Vietnam also use Chinese components and are then shipped to the U.S.

# How Is Vietnam Affected?

As a country with an export-oriented economy and with the United States accounting for 29.51% of its market share (WITS, 2017), Vietnam’s economy could be in big trouble. Labor-intensive sectors like furniture, textiles, and footwear, which used to benefit from low-cost manufacturing, will see lower profit margins. Many producers will be forced to raise prices, making their goods more difficult to compete in the U.S. market.

The technology industry will be seriously hit. It previously benefited from trade tensions between the U.S. and China but is now directly impacted by American tariffs. Vietnam specializes in the final assembly of high-end electronics, with large corporations such as Foxconn, Samsung, LG Electronics, Intel, and Luxshare relying on the country for both labour and low-risk export routes. While multinational firms can shift production or absorb short-term losses, many Vietnamese-owned manufacturers and subcontractors may be forced to shut down. The resulting disruption could severely impact factories, workers, and local economies. 

Vietnam’s semiconductor market is also at risk as the U.S. remains its largest market for semiconductors (Goundar, 2025). Vietnamese manufacturers must find new strategies to maintain production and export under high tariffs, which can cause supply chain instability and rising operational costs. Other electronic export markets, like phones, laptops, and consumer electronics, can also lose market shares to countries and regions that face lower tariffs like India, Mexico, and Eastern Europe.

Investor confidence has been eroded due to the tariffs. Once seen as a stable and attractive destination for foreign capital, Vietnam is now viewed with caution. Major tech firms operating in the country are reportedly pausing or reconsidering expansion plans. Some manufacturers are looking to relocate to countries not subject to such high tariffs, weakening Vietnam’s position as a leading tech manufacturing hub. If investor distrust continues to grow, Vietnam will lose capital and innovation.

However, not all sectors are equally affected. President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs do not apply to steel and aluminum products. These products are already subject to Section 232 tariffs, remaining at 50% worldwide (Jones & O’Carroll, 2025). Vietnam may even benefit, especially when formerly exempted countries, like Canada and Mexico, are also subjected to Section 232 tariffs (The White House, 2025).

# Vietnam’s Response and The Future

Vietnam has responded quickly to the reciprocal tariffs. Following President Trump’s announcement, Vietnamese Party and State leaders have engaged in meetings and phone calls with the U.S. to find a solution that ensures the interests of both sides. On April 3, Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. Trade Representative to show Vietnam’s commitment to addressing U.S. concerns.

In early April, Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phuoc requested a 45-day delay in tariff implementation for in-depth negotiations. Meanwhile, Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade actively cracked down on Chinese goods falsely claiming Vietnamese origin.

By late April and early May, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính had had multiple high-level meetings (around six rounds) to sharpen Vietnam’s negotiation strategy. He promised to address issues on product origins, intellectual property, and administrative procedures. He also pushed agencies to import more U.S. goods, like liquefied natural gas, aircraft, medicine, and farm produce, to rebalance trade.

## Breakthrough: July 2 Tariff Framework Announced

On July 2, 2025, a major breakthrough was made. In a phone call between President Trump and Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Tô Lâm, both sides agreed on a reciprocal tariff framework. Under the agreement:

* A 20% tariff will be imposed on most Vietnamese exports to the U.S, which was a significant reduction from the earlier proposed 46%.  
* A 40% tariff will apply to goods transshipped through Vietnam. This was to control the Chinese goods rerouted to bypass U.S. tariffs.

In return, the U.S. will enjoy tariff-free access to the Vietnamese market for several key exports, including large-engine vehicles, liquefied natural gas, aircraft, medicine, and agricultural goods.

## Implications and Next Steps

The agreement is not without difficulties, even though Vietnamese officials and companies have mostly praised it as a necessary compromise. The 40% transshipment tariff may complicate Vietnam’s trade with China, especially as many Chinese companies use Vietnam as a production or re-routing base. Enforcing rules-of-origin standards could create pressure on Vietnamese manufacturers and exporters.

Moreover, the deal is still only a framework and not yet finalized. Several key questions remain unresolved and will require more time and negotiation. For example, it is unclear whether the 20% tariff applies universally to all non-transshipped goods or whether certain product categories will be granted exemptions. The criteria for determining “transshipped” goods have also not been clearly defined: What proportion of foreign-made components would trigger the penalty tariff?

There are also uncertainties about whether the agreement includes a broader framework for other types of taxes, such as VAT, or whether it addresses non-tariff market barriers that impact bilateral trade flows.

The final terms of the agreement must be settled by July 9, when the previously announced U.S. tariffs are set to take effect. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether this framework can evolve into a durable and mutually beneficial trade arrangement.

## The Future

Vietnam’s diplomacy has helped prevent the worst-case scenario, yet its future still remains uncertain. If implemented smoothly, this agreement could enhance Vietnam’s global credibility and long-term appeal to investors. But much depends on how the fine print is handled in the coming days.
