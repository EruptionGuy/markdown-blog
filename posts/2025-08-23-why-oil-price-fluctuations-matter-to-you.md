Global Oil Price Drivers are primarily driven by the fundamental forces of supply and demand, with geopolitical events, economic growth, and the actions of key players such as OPEC also playing significant roles. OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is the main influencer of fluctuations in oil prices. It comprises 12 countries: Algeria, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. 

# Effects on Price of Goods & Transport

When oil prices fluctuate, they create impacts on the cost of producing daily products, because oil is not only used for fuel but also as a raw material in manufacturing. Products like plastics, chemicals, and even packaging materials are made by using oil-based substances. Therefore, when oil prices go up, the production cost also increases, leading to higher prices for consumers to buy and making it harder for manufacturers to keep control of the prices. 

Moreover, transportation is affected as well as production costs. Shipping companies rely heavily on bunker fuel, which is made from oil, to install large cargo ships. As a result of rising fuel prices, bunker fuel becomes more expensive, making shipping costs go up. The increase in freight rates creates effects on the transportation of goods around the world, which can make imported items more expensive and reduce profit margins for businesses. 

These fluctuations create budgeting challenges for companies. It becomes more difficult for one company to plan how much to spend on materials, transportation, and production. Businesses may face delays, unexpected costs, or shortages of goods in selling, disrupting the entire supply chain. Also, managing inventory and meeting customer demand becomes harder, and companies must find ways to prevent risks and deal with unpredictable oil prices. 

# Government Responses to Changing Oil Prices

To deal with the fluctuation of oil prices, governments like the United States used their Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR). This is a large supply of stored oil that can be issued to the public when there is a sudden shortage in oil, helping bring the price of oil down and making sure that there is enough oil in the short term.

Other governments, like those in the European Union and the United States, also deal with this problem by creating special taxes on oil companiesâ€™ extra profits during times of high prices, which are called windfall taxes. From that, the money collected from these taxes can be used to help people and businesses deal with higher energy costs. 

Additionally, lawmakers in the U.S have proposed a bill like the OPEC bill, which is meant to stop OPEC, a group of countries that produce oil, from working together to control oil prices. The goal is to keep the oil market fair and prevent price manipulation that can hurt customers and the economy.
