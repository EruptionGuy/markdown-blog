# Command Economies

## Definition

Sometimes called a planned economy, a command economy is an economic system where the **government maintains control** over the **production and pricing of goods and services**.

The government decides which goods and services to produce, the production and distribution methods, and the prices of goods and services. The government is the central planner and decision-maker.

## Core Features 

### Social Welfare Programs

In a command economy, the government often ensures that basic needs are met. Housing, healthcare, education, and food are universally provided through centralized planning. These services are typically free or heavily subsidized. The goal is to promote equality and eliminate poverty, with resources allocated based on social priorities rather than profitability.

### Price Controls / Subsidies

Prices are set entirely by the state rather than market supply and demand. The government may fix prices to maintain affordability and control inflation. It also provides subsidies directly to key sectors, such as agriculture or heavy industry, not to support competition but to meet planned production targets and ensure strategic national development.

### Strong Business Regulations

In a command economy, the government directly owns or controls most businesses and industries. Private ownership is either limited or non-existent. Regulations are not just meant to correct market failures, but they also define how the entire economy functions. Enterprises follow production quotas and instructions set by government planners instead of responding to market signals.

# Market Economies 

## Definition

The activity in a market economy is **not organized by a central authority but is determined by the supply and demand for goods and services.** Consumer preferences and resource scarcity determine which goods are produced and in what quantity.

## Core Features 

### Market Participation

In a market economy, core market players, such as individuals, businesses, and corporations, are generally free to produce, sell, and purchase goods and services as they see fit. This economic freedom allows for a diverse range of choices for consumers and encourages innovation among producers.

### Profit Motive and Market Dynamics

The driving force behind most economic activity in a market economy is the profit motive. Producers seek to sell their goods and services at the highest price the market will bear, while consumers aim to pay the lowest possible prices for the items they need. This dual motivation creates a dynamic system of supply and demand where pricing and production levels adjust based on consumer behavior and producer strategy. The profit motive not only incentivizes innovation and efficiency but also encourages businesses to respond quickly to changes in consumer preferences and market conditions.

### Competition and Efficiency

One of the defining features of a market economy is competition among producers. This competition helps keep prices reasonable and quality high, while also driving innovation and economic growth. When multiple businesses compete for consumer attention and loyalty, they are motivated to operate more efficiently and improve their offerings. 

# Mixed Economies

## Definition

A mixed economic system has features of **both a command economy and a free-market system.** It is controlled to some degree by the government, but growth is driven by the forces of supply and demand and the involvement of the public and private sectors.

## Core Features 

### Coexistence of Private and Public Sectors

In a mixed economy, both privately-owned companies and government-run enterprises operate side by side. This dual structure allows for the efficiency and innovation often associated with private businesses, while also enabling the government to provide essential goods and services that may not be profitable but are vital to public welfare. For instance, a country might have privately-run grocery stores and car manufacturers, while also maintaining public transportation systems or state-owned energy providers to ensure accessibility and affordability.

### Government Intervention

In mixed economies, governments regulate economic activity and promote social welfare. This includes providing public goods and services like roads, public education, and healthcare, which may not be efficiently supplied by the private sector. Additionally, governments use taxation and redistribution policies to reduce inequality and support vulnerable populations. For example, progressive tax systems and welfare programs help ensure that wealth is shared more equitably across society.

### Limited Central Planning

While market forces largely determine production and pricing in a mixed economy, governments may still engage in targeted economic planning. This planning is typically limited to specific sectors deemed important for national development, such as renewable energy, infrastructure, or technology. Governments might set long-term goals, provide incentives, or make strategic investments to guide economic growth in these areas. Unlike in a command economy, however, this planning coexists with the freedom of private enterprise. 

# Country Examples

## North Korea: Command Economy

The first phase of North Korea's economic development, following the division of the formerly unified kingdom, was dominated by industrialization. This was a difficult task, considering the damage the country's infrastructure weathered during the Korean War. North Korea assumed the Soviet model of governance and centrally planned socialist economics, as well as the ideology of “juche” (self-reliance). This model emphasized the development of heavy industry and investments in the iron, steel, cement, and machine tool sectors.

## USA: Market Economy

While no country today operates as a purely market economy, the United States is widely seen as a strong example of a market-oriented economy. It has a relatively free market with limited government intervention in most sectors. The primary forces driving the U.S. economy are supply and demand, with producers and consumers making most economic decisions. However, the government still plays an important role. The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, uses monetary policy to maintain economic stability, aiming for full employment and low inflation. Congress can also enact laws to stimulate growth or protect consumers, but these interventions typically support rather than replace market mechanisms.

## Vietnam: Mixed Economy

Vietnam operates under a mixed economy, officially termed a "socialist-oriented market economy". This means it blends elements of a market economy with state control, aiming to achieve both economic growth and socialist ideals. The government plays a significant role in directing the economy through state-owned enterprises (SOEs), planning, and strategic investments, while also encouraging private sector activity and foreign investment.

# Pros and Cons of Each System

## Command Economy

### Pros

* Government control can reduce unemployment and inflation, leading to a stable economy.  
* Resources can be mobilized quickly, which is useful in crises (e.g., war, disaster recovery).  
* Aims to reduce income gaps and provide basic needs (education, healthcare) for all.  
* No competition, reducing business failures and market uncertainty.

### Cons

* Lack of innovation and efficiency; there is no profit incentive, which can cause low productivity.  
* There can be mismatches in supply and demand due to central planning.  
* Consumers and producers have limited freedom and few choices.  
* Centralized planning can become inefficient and self-serving, ideal for bureaucracy and corruption.

## Market Economy

### Pros

* Profit motive encourages better products and lower costs.  
* Consumers can choose a wide variety of goods and services.  
* Prices adjust based on demand and supply.  
* Entrepreneurship thrives, and new businesses and ideas are rewarded.

### Cons

* Wealth is unevenly distributed; vulnerable groups may be neglected.  
* No safety net if businesses fail or automate.  
* Public goods (like clean air, education) may be underprovided.  
* Firms may prioritize profit over environmental or social impact.

## Mixed Economy

### Pros

* A balanced approach that combines efficiency with social welfare.  
* The government can reduce quality by providing subsidies, public services, and social safety nets.  
* The government can correct market failures, regulate pollution, protect consumers, and support essential industries.  
* Encourages innovation and growth, allowing private business and competition.

### Cons

* If the government operates inefficiently, overregulation or poor policies can hinder growth.  
* Economic decisions may be swayed by politics rather than public interest.  
* Higher taxes are needed to fund public services and welfare programs.  
* Conflicts can arise over what should be controlled or left to the market.


# Đổi Mới Policy: An Example of Transitioning From a Command Economy to a Market Economy

## Background & Context

**Pre-reform legacy:** After decades of war and centralized planning, Vietnam’s economic infrastructure was severely hampered. Beginning in the 1980s, the government launched Đổi Mới (“renovation”), transitioning toward a socialist-oriented market economy.

**Hybrid system:** While state-owned enterprises (SOEs), state banks, and the energy sector remain prominent, private firms now operate under market rules. SOEs still produce over a quarter of industrial output and employ nearly 9% of workers.

## Key Successes

### Rapid GDP Growth

Averaging over 7% annually since the 1990s, propelled by robust industrial and commercial expansion, industrial output grew \~15% per year and accounts for \~40% of GDP.

### Booming Foreign Trade & Investment

Post–2001 trade accords and WTO accession (2007) drove foreign trade up tenfold from 1995–2008. FDI contributed significantly, e.g., Intel’s $1 billion semiconductor plant.

### Agricultural Transformation

Reforms granted farmers autonomy, turning Vietnam into a top global exporter of rice and the world’s second-largest coffee producer by 2006\. Agriculture now sustains exports and the domestic food supply.

### Housing and Domestic Market Boom

Rapid urban housing development fueled by rising incomes, creating jobs in construction and related industries; however, concerns of a property bubble persist.

### Demographic Dividend & Diaspora Contributions

A youthful, educated population supports growth. Meanwhile, overseas Vietnamese (Việt Kiều) send \~$7.4 billion in remittances (2008) and increasingly return to invest or work.

### Social Service Improvements

**Education:** Despite initial setbacks post‑Đổi Mới, enrollment rates rebounded. By 2008, primary completion reached \~94%, and 16% of young adults entered higher education. This was a substantial rise from the early 1990s.

**Health:** Life expectancy grew from \~65 to 71 years (1995–2005), and infant mortality decreased. Preventive measures (e.g., vaccinations) remain strong, though access and quality disparities have emerged due to privatization.

## Major Challenges

### Persistent Regional Poverty

Rural poverty (\~20%) significantly outpaces urban (\~4%). Remote ethnic minority regions (e.g., Central Highlands) still show poverty rates of 30–65%.

### Corruption

A byproduct of rapid liberalization and weak legal frameworks, in 2009, Vietnam ranked 120/180 in corruption perception. High-level concerns and some anti-corruption efforts are ongoing.

### Environmental Degradation

Accelerated deforestation, soil erosion, and industrial pollution accompany growth, with forest cover declining sharply from the late 1960s onward.

### Fragile Banking & Finance System

Dominated by state banks, plagued by past crises, hyperinflation, and widespread unbanked populations. Less than 6% had bank accounts (2007). The sector awaits reform through WTO commitments and foreign entry.

### Outlook & Road Ahead

**Growth drivers:** Favorable demographics, strategic location, and abundant cheap labor promise continued growth, especially in labor-intensive industries.

**Future priorities:** Vietnam should focus on balancing growth with structural issues, reducing inequality, improving infrastructure, modernizing financial systems, containing pollution, and strengthening social services.
