Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxation to influence a country's economy. It is one of the main tools governments use to manage economic performance, especially to control inflation, reduce unemployment, and promote growth.

# Expansionary vs. Contractionary Fiscal Policy

Depending on the economic situation, governments can decide whether to use expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy. The goal of these policies is to restore the economy back to long-run equilibrium, where resources are fully employed and inflation is stable.

## Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Expansionary fiscal policy is typically used when the economy is experiencing a recession or economic slowdown. These periods are characterized by high unemployment and low consumer spending.

This policy involves increasing government spending and cutting taxes, which usually results in a budget deficit (government spending exceeds its tax revenue). By spending more on infrastructure, services, or direct aid, the government is injecting more money into the economy. Meanwhile, lower taxes give consumers and businesses more money to spend or invest.

This policy primarily increases aggregate demand, which helps reduce unemployment by encouraging businesses to produce more and hire more workers. But if expansionary measures are too strong or prolonged, they can lead to higher inflation.

## Contractionary Fiscal Policy

Contractionary fiscal policy is used when the economy faces high inflation or is overheating due to excessive demand. In such situations, prices may rise too quickly, reducing purchasing power and potentially destabilizing the economy.

This policy involves decreasing government spending and increasing taxes, typically resulting in a budget surplus (government revenue exceeds its spending). Reduced government expenditure slows the flow of money into the economy, and higher taxes limit consumers' and businesses' spending.

Contractionary fiscal policy decreases aggregate demand and helps reduce inflation, although it can lead to higher unemployment as businesses scale back production or delay expansion due to weaker demand.

|  | Expansionary Fiscal Policy | Contractionary Fiscal Policy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Used when | The economy is in a recession | The economy is experiencing high inflation |
| Actions | Increasing government spending Decreasing taxes | Decreasing government spending Increasing taxes |
| Effects | Increases aggregate demand Reduces unemployment Leads to higher inflation | Decreases aggregate demand Increases unemployment Leads to lower inflation |

# The History of Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy is largely based on the ideas of British economist John Maynard Keynes. He argued that economic recessions result from a lack of consumer spending and business investment. He believed that governments could stabilize the economy by adjusting spending and tax policies to offset the shortfalls of the private sector. His theories, which were developed during the Great Depression, challenged old-school economic views and influenced major policy responses like the New Deal that focused on large-scale public spending and social programs.

# The Bottom Line

Governments implement fiscal policy to maintain a healthy economy. When the economy slows down or is experiencing a recession, expansionary fiscal policy is used. When the economy faces high inflation or overheating, contractionary monetary policy is used.
