Monetary policy is a set of tools used by the central bank (like the Federal Reserve in the U.S. or the State Bank of Vietnam) to influence a country’s economy by managing the money supply and interest rates. 

# The Role of Central Banks

Central banks are national authorities that oversee a country’s monetary and financial systems. They maintain economic stability by regulating commercial banks, issuing currency, and shaping the economy through monetary policy. Central banks often function as independent entities that are free from political influence. They can make objective decisions that put long-term economic goals above short-term political goals. While central banks often coordinate with the government on broader economic strategies, the government generally cannot directly control the central bank’s actions.

Most countries in the world have their own central bank. Well-known examples include the Federal Reserve (U.S.), the European Central Bank (EU), the Bank of Japan, and the State Bank of Vietnam.

# Expansionary vs. Contractionary Monetary Policy

Depending on the economic situation, central banks can decide when to use expansionary or contractionary monetary policy. Similar to [fiscal policy](/post.html?file=2025-10-04-fiscal-policy-how-governments-spend-and-tax.md), the goal of monetary policy is to restore the economy back to long-run equilibrium, where resources are fully employed and inflation is stable.

## Expansionary Monetary Policy

Expansionary monetary policy is typically used when the economy is experiencing a recession or slowdown. These periods are defined by high unemployment and low consumer spending.

To stimulate economic activity, central banks may lower the interest rate, reduce the required reserve ratio, and buy government bonds.

* When interest rates fall, borrowing is cheaper for businesses and consumers. A lower interest rate encourages households to take out loans for things like homes or cars and motivates businesses to invest in capital goods such as equipment or new facilities.

* Reducing the required reserve ratio (the fraction of deposits that commercial banks must hold and not lend) increases the amount of money available for banks to loan out and promotes spending.

* When the central bank buys government bonds from commercial banks or the public, it injects money into the economy. In exchange for the bonds, banks and investors receive cash, increasing bank reserves and allowing more lending.

Together, these measures lead to greater borrowing, consumption, and investment, raising aggregate demand. As demand grows, businesses increase production and hire more workers, reducing unemployment. However, a side effect of expansionary monetary policy is that it can lead to rising inflation if sustained too long or implemented too aggressively.

## Contractionary Fiscal Policy

Contractionary monetary policy is implemented when the economy is overheating or experiencing high inflation. In such cases, prices may rise too quickly, reducing purchasing power and potentially destabilizing the economy.

To reduce inflation, central banks may increase interest rates, raise the required reserve ratio, and sell government bonds.

* Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and discourage consumer spending and business investments.

* Increasing the required reserve ratio restricts the amount of money commercial banks can loan out, reducing the overall money supply and slowing down economic activity.

* Selling government bonds withdraws money from the economy. As banks and investors receive bonds, they give up cash. This decreases the amount of reserves available for loans.

Together, these measures lead to reduced borrowing, lower consumption and investment, and a decrease in aggregate demand. This helps bring inflation under control, but it also increases unemployment since businesses have to decrease production and lay off workers in response to weaker demand.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What Is the Difference Between Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy?

Monetary and fiscal policies are both used to influence a country’s economic performance, especially in terms of inflation, employment, and growth. They differ in who implements them and how they work.

* Monetary policy is carried out by the central bank, which uses tools like interest rates, reserve requirements, and open market operations (e.g., buying or selling government bonds) to control the money supply and influence aggregate demand.

* Fiscal policy is managed by the government to adjust spending levels and tax rates in order to stimulate or slow down the economy.

These two types of policies can work together or independently. For example, during a recession, a government might increase spending (expansionary fiscal policy) while the central bank lowers interest rates (expansionary monetary policy) to encourage borrowing, investment, and consumption. During periods of high inflation, both may take contractionary policies to cool down the economy.

## How Does the Central Bank Increase/Decrease Interest Rates?

The central bank does not directly set the interest rates charged to consumers and businesses by commercial banks. Instead, it influences them by adjusting the **discount rate**, the interest rate that it lends money directly to commercial banks.

When the central bank raises the discount rate, it becomes more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. To maintain profitability, commercial banks respond by raising their own interest rates for households and businesses, which discourages borrowing and slows down economic activity.

When the central bank lowers the discount rate, banks can borrow more cheaply. They can lower interest rates, making loans more attractive to consumers and encouraging spending and investment.

# The Bottom Line

Central banks implement monetary policy to maintain a healthy economy. When the economy slows down or is experiencing a recession, expansionary monetary policy is used. When the economy faces high inflation or overheating, contractionary monetary policy is used.
