# What is Greenwashing?

Greenwashing is the process of conveying false or misleading information to deceive customers about how a company’s product is environmentally friendly or has a positive environmental impact. It often involves emphasizing the sustainable aspects of a product to hide the environmentally damaging practices. In essence, greenwashing manipulates public perception and capitalizes on growing consumer interest in sustainability without committing to real change.

# Real World Examples of Greenwashing

## Volkswagen

One of the most well-known cases of greenwashing is Volkswagen’s emissions scandal. The company admitted to installing software in its vehicles that could detect when an emissions test was taking place and adjust the car’s performance to produce lower emission readings. Outside of testing conditions, these vehicles emitted pollutants well above legal limits.

## Coca-Cola

Ranked the world’s number one plastic polluter for two years in a row, Coca-Cola faced criticism in 2020 after refusing to stop using plastic bottles, citing customer preference. Despite promoting efforts to recycle all bottles by 2030 and introducing 100% recycled bottles in some markets, the company was sued in 2021 by Earth Island Institute for falsely advertising itself as sustainable while remaining the top global source of plastic pollution.

## Starbucks

In 2018, Starbucks introduced a “straw-less lid” as part of its sustainability campaign, but the new lid contained more plastic than the previous straw-and-lid design. While the company claimed the material was recyclable, critics noted that only a small percentage of plastic is actually recycled. Additionally, a significant portion of U.S. plastic waste is exported to developing countries, raising concerns that Starbucks was shifting its environmental responsibility elsewhere.

# Why is Greenwashing Harmful?

Greenwashing greatly undermines the sustainability efforts made by misleading consumers, creates mistrust in environmental claims, and gives unfair advantage to companies that avoid real change. When companies lie about their eco-friendly practices, it becomes harder for people to make the choices that truly help their environment. This delays progress towards solving environmental issues like climate change and pollution, but can lead to an increase in malpractice if left unchecked.

# How to Recognize Greenwashing?

Spotting greenwashing can be challenging, but there are signs that consumers can watch for. One major red flag is vague or unsubstantiated language, terms like “eco-friendly,” “green,” or “sustainable” that aren’t supported by clear data or third-party certification. Misleading imagery is also very common since companies often use visuals of nature, greenery, or symbols that suggest environmental friendliness without any evidence to support the implication.

Products that highlight a single “green” feature while ignoring other environmental harms are another example. For instance, a company might advertise recycled packaging but ignore the fact that the product itself is produced in a carbon-intensive way. Additionally, consumers should be cautious of exaggerated claims, such as items labeled “100% biodegradable,” which may only break down under specific industrial conditions that are rarely met in reality. Eco-labels can also be deceptive, especially if they resemble official certifications but lack legitimate backing or regulation.

# What Brands and Consumers Can Do

To avoid greenwashing, companies should be transparent and accountable. This means relying on credible third-party certifications, avoiding vague or feel-good language, and backing up sustainability claims with measurable data. Marketing efforts should be honest, and any environmental benefit should be contextualized within the company’s broader operations.

Consumers, in turn, can make more informed choices by researching brands before making purchases. Look into whether a company publishes sustainability reports, works with independent certifiers, or has a track record of environmental transparency. Choose products with recognized certifications and supporting companies with genuine sustainability commitments. At the same time, use your voices to challenge greenwashing when you see it: call out misleading practices and demand accountability.
