# What Are Tariffs?

Tariffs are special taxes that one country puts on products from another country. They are used to make foreign goods more expensive, so people are more likely to buy products made locally. For example, if the US adds a 100% tariff on Chinese furniture, the price of that furniture doubles in the US. This might lead customers to buy American-made furniture instead. While tariffs can help local businesses, they also raise prices for shoppers and can lead to conflicts between countries.

# Recent US–China Trade Trends

Here is a summary of what happened between the United States and China:

* The US and China have been engaged in a long trade war in recent years.

* Both countries raised tariffs on each other’s goods.

* By 2025, some US tariffs on Chinese products reached as high as 125%.

* China responded by applying similar tariffs on US products.

* In May 2025, both countries agreed to pause the trade war for 90 days.

* During this pause, tariffs were lowered to about 30%.

* This pause is temporary, and many issues remain unresolved.

* Many companies are moving factories out of China to avoid high tariffs.

# Impact on Vietnamese Exports & Jobs

At first, Vietnam gained a lot from the US–China trade war. As companies left China, they moved to Vietnam, helping the country’s exports grow fast. This created many new jobs, especially in clothing, furniture, and electronics. Women made up a large part of this new workforce.

But in 2025, things changed. The US placed new tariffs on Vietnamese goods, about 46–48%, because they were concerned that Vietnamese products used too many Chinese parts. These tariffs make Vietnamese products more expensive for American buyers. If US companies buy less from Vietnam, factories might cut jobs, and economic growth could slow down. Some experts say Vietnam’s growth could drop from 6.8% to 5.8% this year.

Another issue is that many Vietnamese products still rely on materials from China. The US worries that some items may be Chinese goods re-labeled as “Made in Vietnam,” which could lead to even more trade restrictions.

# Strategy: Business and Policy Level

To respond to these challenges, Vietnam needs strong strategies from both businesses and the government.

Vietnamese businesses should sell to other markets like Japan, Europe, and India, not just the US. They should use fewer Chinese materials and rely more on local or regional suppliers. They must also improve product quality and focus on more advanced, high-tech goods, and most importantly, keep clear records showing where products and materials come from.

The Vietnamese government needs to support companies and protect the economy. It should sign new trade agreements with other countries to reduce dependence on the US and China. Tax breaks, training programs, and easier access to technology can help local businesses grow. Vietnam should also improve business rules and reduce paperwork so companies can operate more easily. At the global level, the government can use diplomacy and international organizations to explain Vietnam’s position and ask for fair treatment in trade.
