When talking about digital currency, lots of people will think about “Bitcoin”. But the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is not only just that; it is a dynamic world of technology, functionality, and much more. From decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts to NFTs and supply chain innovations, blockchain technology is quietly reshaping entire industries. In this blog, we will explore more about this technology and its impact on our lives. 

# Blockchain Fundamentals 

So, what is the blockchain? According to PhD Adam Hayes, blockchain is a distributed database with the data shared across a computer network’s nodes. It plays an important role in cryptocurrency systems and the decentralized record of transferring. It can also be used to make data in any immutable industry. Some of the creations based on blockchain are new cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, etc.), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. 

# How Does Blockchain Work? 

You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. Blockchain is similar to that, but more complicated.

First, it will record the transaction to a “block”. Each “block” will capture the movement of property, including both tangible property and intangible property. Each “block” contains critical information about the user or the status of the transaction.

Then, each block will be connected to the previous block to create a chain of data. This step is done through the cryptographic hashes, which makes the data in the block nearly impossible to alter any block without changing the order of the block.

After that, the blocks are grouped together into a chain called “blockchain”. Each new block increases the validation and security of the previous block. This makes the blockchain tamper-evident, ensuring malicious actors cannot alter or insert fraudulent transactions into the chain. Finally, with each new block, the blockchain will become safer and nearly impossible to change past transactions. 

# Beyond Crypto, Use Cases 

The three main cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA) play a special role in the digital money industry. For Bitcoin, it is a digital wallet for those who do not have access to banking services. It can also be a solution for nations struggling with inflationary or political issues; citizens can avoid depending on cash and create a store of value without using financial services from the public bank.

Ethereum can be used as a decentralised network for applications and smart contracts. The development of Ethereum laid the foundation for the invention of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and ERC20, which currently provides the world’s leading platform for distributed computing. 

IOTA can be used to connect services and resources in the IoT. It is a project behind the Tangle, an open-source distributed ledger that has the objective of creating an environment in which machines trade services and resources with each other.  

# Cryptocurrency Pros And Cons 

With the development of technology and industrialization, crypto is starting to have a position in the currency system and an impact on our lives. Using cryptocurrency can help users reduce the cost of transferring. As an individual system, cryptocurrency can be transferred globally, which can drastically reduce the cost of moving abroad without third parties like VISA. Another benefit is safety and security. Thanks to the blockchain system, every transaction will be secured through 3 protective layers: public and private keys, proof of work or proof of stake, and other various forms of incentive systems.

On the other hand, cryptocurrency still has some weaknesses. According to Nikita Tambe, writer for Forbes, although cryptocurrency transfer is anonymous, it is pseudonymous, meaning that it still can be tracked by the FBI or other political organizations. Furthermore, the lack of key transactions might be a major problem. Your transactions can’t be undone by the blockchain security system, which means you cannot receive a refund if you lose the security key. 

# Using Cryptocurrencies Responsibly

Investing in crypto is very risky because of the complicated and unstable crypto market. If you don’t want to throw your money down the drain, you should follow some useful tips:

* First, starting small is very important, especially with young investors. One of the big mistakes that most newcomers are prone to is investing their money in cryptocurrency more than they can afford to lose. In an unstable market, investing carefully is very necessary if you don’t want to waste your money.

* Another tip is learning about finance, investment, and digital money so that you can have a basic knowledge before transacting or investing.

* Finally, always be up-to-date with crypto as it is an unstable market. Follow credible news sources and be cautious of hype or "get-rich-quick" schemes. 

# Conclusion 

As a relatively new invention, blockchain and cryptocurrency have much potential and a major future impact on human life. However, it is still too dangerous for new investors and might take a long time to be acceptable, not only for the government, but also for the community.
