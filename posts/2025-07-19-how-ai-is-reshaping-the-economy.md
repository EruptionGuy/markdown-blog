AI isn’t only streamlining Netflix recommendations, but it’s also rewiring the global economy. According to McKinsey, an American multinational strategy and management consulting firm, AI is expected to unlock $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in annual value across industries. But where exactly is all this money coming from?

# What Is AI?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, and autonomy.

Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car).

# Effects on Employment

The integration of AI and automation into the workforce is changing the job market. It introduces new opportunities but also raises concerns about job displacement. As AI systems and machines take over routine and manual tasks (manufacturing and low-skilled sectors), many existing roles are becoming obsolete. As a result, manufacturing workers need to acquire new skills to operate and maintain machines and robots that are taking over manual tasks. 

At the same time, this shift is generating new job categories. The rise of AI in high-tech manufacturing has led to the demand for data analysts, AI programmers, and machine learning specialists. But these new positions often require advanced technical skills that may not be easily accessible to all workers. Consequently, the evolution of job roles shows a growing divide between people who can adapt to technological change and those who are left behind.

Yet, one of AI’s greatest benefits is its ability to promote inclusion, particularly for persons with disabilities, chronic illnesses, neurodivergence, and non-native language speakers. The World Bank has discussed how digital work can encourage employment inclusion in developing countries. For example, the social enterprises Digital Divide Data in Cambodia and Enablecode in Vietnam connect youth with physical disabilities to outsourced digital jobs. AI-powered assistive tools, such as the Dot Watch for persons with visual disabilities, help individuals perform tasks that may have otherwise been inaccessible.

AI can also support non-native language speakers by identifying grammatical errors or improving pronunciation, enhancing communication among global and multinational teams. These emerging technologies would remove access barriers in English-predominant spaces for international scholars and professionals in non-Western contexts.

By using AI not only to streamline processes but also to support vulnerable groups, businesses can promote equity in the workplace. Still, as some roles disappear and others emerge, the responsibility lies in ensuring that the workforce is equipped to navigate these changes through education, training, and inclusive policy design.

# Productivity Change

*The Smart Nonprofit* defines smart tech as “the AI and other advanced digital technologies that automate work by taking over tasks that only people could do previously. Smart tech makes decisions instead of and for people.” This means that AI is no longer just helping humans with decisions, but is now capable of replacing human judgment altogether in certain tasks. In some cases, the technology is performing actions entirely on its own ("instead of people"), and in others, it's making decisions on behalf of humans ("for people") so that users don’t have to think about them.

However, McKinsey believes fears that automation will replace human jobs are largely baseless. The company discovered that less than 5% of jobs can be fully automated, and few jobs can be completely replaced by smart tech. Though automation can definitely add efficiency to the work experience.

Unlike McKinsey, not all experts agree that the threat is minimal. While only a small percentage of jobs can be fully automated, many more can be partially automated. This could lead to fewer working hours, reducing job stability and eliminating middle-skill jobs.

# Risks vs. Opportunities

## Automation of Routine Tasks

AI can automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and email filtering. This frees up employees to focus on more strategic and creative work. For instance, many organizations use AI-powered tools like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle routine data processing tasks, significantly reducing human error and increasing efficiency.

## Enhanced Decision-Making

AI-driven analytics can process vast amounts of data to provide insights that would be impossible for humans to generate on their own. For example, in the financial sector, AI algorithms analyze market trends, customer behavior, and economic indicators to help investors make informed decisions.

## Improved Talent Management

AI tools are increasingly being used in recruitment and HR management to screen resumes, assess candidates, and even predict employee turnover. For instance, AI-driven platforms can analyze a candidate's online presence, work history, and skill set to identify the best fit for a role.

# How Can Students Prepare for an AI-Driven Job Market?

Students must be prepared not only for specific careers but also for the flexibility to transition across different roles and industries. Dr. Kelly Dore, a PhD researcher with a background in cognitive psychology and higher education, highlights the importance of “[durable skills](https://americasucceeds.org/policy-priorities/durable-skills#:~:text=Durable%20Skills%20include%20a%20combination,%2C%20growth%20mindset%2C%20and%20leadership.),” or human skills such as critical thinking, resiliency, communication, teamwork, and leadership. These skills enable students to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of AI and take advantage of new opportunities. 

# Conclusion

By carefully balancing the opportunities and risks of AI, organizations can leverage this technology to its fullest potential while minimizing the chances of negative outcomes. In doing so, businesses can create a workplace environment where AI acts as a force for positive change, driving innovation and growth while maintaining ethical standards and protecting the interests of all stakeholders.

The key to successful AI integration lies in thoughtful planning, continuous education, and a commitment to ethical practices. With the right approach, AI can be a powerful ally in achieving your organization's goals, paving the way for a more efficient, innovative, and ethical future.
